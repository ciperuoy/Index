  Index is a legal mod for Gorilla Tag adding a panel to the game with a variety of different mods. This is a mod, not a cheat, meaning it will only work in modded lobbies, compatible with Utilla or Newtilla. This is also not considered a mod menu, but a mod toggler/panel, like KyleTheScientist's 'Bark' or Graze's 'Grate'.
